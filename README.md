###### This project is split into 2 main directories, `client` and `server`.

The [client](client) handles the user-side of things: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. AKA the _front end_.

The [server](server) is the [API](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api), it handles requests and responses for information, authentication, and database communication. AKA the _back end_.
