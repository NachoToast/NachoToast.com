    This one is quite tricky, the reason 'a_list2' stays as [1, 3, 4] is because 'list3' only exists inside the scope of the 'exercise04' function, so while in the function, 'list2' is [9, 10, 9] because it points to 'list3', as soon as it comes out of the function 'list3' no longer exists, so it goes back to its original address of [1, 3, 4].
    (I could be wrong about this, if so please let me know.)
